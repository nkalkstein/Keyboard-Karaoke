# Keyboard Karaoke

A music-driven, timed typing game in which you type lyrics to a song while the music video plays.

Choose a video and then try to keep up typing the lyrics that appear on screen before the verse ends.

You get a strike every time you can't finish a verse in time.

You have ten strikes before time's up but you get points for each letter you get right, so go for the high score!

# Motivation

Karaoke is fun, but when you're on the computer it's not always possible.  

With Keyboard Karaoke, you can combine your knowledge of music and lyrics with your typing skills.

Fast typing, lyrics and music videos; what's not to love?

This game is very challenging and fun to play.  You can choose your level of difficulty.
