# Keyboard Karaoke

A music-driven, timed typing game in which you type lyrics to a song while the music video plays.

Choose a video and then try to keep up typing the lyrics that appear on screen before the verse ends.

You get a strike every time you can't finish a verse in time.

You have ten strikes before time's up but you get points for each letter you get right, so go for the high score!
